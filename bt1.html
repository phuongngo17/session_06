    <h1> What is CSS?</h1>
    <p>Casscading Style Sheet (CSS) is used to fomat the layout of a webpage.</p>
    <h5>With CSS, you can control the colors, font, the size of text, the soacing between elements, how element are
        positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for
        different devices and screen sizes, and much morel.</h5>
    <h5 style="color: black; background-color: blanchedalmond;font-weight: 100;"><b>Tip:</b>the word
        <b>Casscading</b>means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children
        elements
        within the parent. So, if you set the color of the body text to "blue", all headings, paragraphs, and orther
        text elements within the body will also get the same color (unless you specify something else)
    </h5>
